## Data science in three stages
Data science is a process of asking questions to your data, and getting from raw data to a statistically valid answer to those questions. It involves getting useable data, exploring the data by visualizing it or calculating summary statistics, and then establishing a hypothesis and running an experiment to test it.

### 1. Preparing your data
How to clean up data. If you've worked in Business Intelligence before, you can probably skip this section.

### 2. Exploring your data
Much of data science begins with intuition. Often the best intuitions come from _looking_ at the data.

### 3. Running an experiment
This is where you learn about the _science_ in data science.
