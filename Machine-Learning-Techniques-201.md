# Machine Learning Techniques 201

## A Mathematical Overview of Machine Learning
This is _the_ course. Make sure you've covered the basics of [statistics](../Data Science Basics 101.md) and you know what an algorithm [wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) is before you dive in here.

| Course | Environment | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) | Octave, MATLAB | Taught by Andrew Ng. Best course you can take.  You can easily complete the exercises in R or Python instead of Octave or MATLAB if you prefer. Exercises can be considered optional.

## Specific Machine Learning Areas
What follows are courses on specific machine learning areas. You do not need to go through each course. Pick a few that look interesting to you.

### Regression
This is the "original" machine learning technique, and much of machine learning is a riff on this original concept of fitting a straight line to a bunch of data points. If you understand the concepts behind regression analysis, much of the rest of data science will fall into place for you. Example applications: finding correlations, predicting the future.

### Classification
This is where you learn about those famous decision trees. Example applications are sentiment analysis, prediction algorthims.

### Clustering
Clustering is the art of grouping data into similar chuncks, and hence find similar objects. Examples include recommending/finding similar documents or products.

### Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing is a large sub-field within machine learning. Here we learn how to analyze natural language, translate it, evaluate it's sentiment, figure out what a user means, and search a corpus of text.

### Graph analysis
Many data sets can be analysed as graphs (Facebook friends, web page links, transportation grids). These are understood as vertices (nodes, points) and edges (lines, connections) which form a graph. such a graph can be analyzed to find friends of friends, shortest route between two addresses, most referenced websites, etc.
