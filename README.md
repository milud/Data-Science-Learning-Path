# Data-Science-Learning-Path
This project aims to provide those new to machine learning and data science a learning path for gradually learning everything they need to know to be a competent data scientist. The learning path is intended to help students understand what order they need to learn topics in, and which are currently the best courses out there for doing so. 

Each of these files contains an ordered list of links to existing online courses (Coursera, EDX, Pluralsight, etc.) as well as explanations as to what the course covers and why it is important. 

The learning path consists of 100, 200 and 300-level courses. You should be able to follow any 200-level course after you have completed most of the 100-level courses, etc.

## The basics (100 level)
* [Data Science 101](../Data-Science-Basics-101.md)

## The main areas in data science (200 and 300 level)
* [Data Science as an experimental process](../Data-Science-as-a-Process-201.md)
* [Machine Learning Techniques](../Machine-Learning-Techniques-201.md)
* Deep Learning
* Big Data and Data Science
